# Reveal

The Reveal component is basically an Intersection Observer and a Timeline component combined.

All children Tween and Timeline components get played when they are visible in viewport.


    import { Reveal, Tween } from 'react-gsap';

## Usage with Tween

Add a little space for testing

<Playground>
  <Reveal repeat>
    <Tween from={{ opacity: 0 }} duration={2}>
      <h3>This headline is fading in</h3>
    </Tween>
  </Reveal>
</Playground>

## FadeInLeft component

Of course you can outsource animations to separate components. In this example a FadeInLeft animation:

```javascript
const FadeInLeft = ({ children }) => (
  <Tween
    from={{ opacity: 0, transform: 'translate3d(-100vw, 0, 0)' }}
    ease="back.out(1.4)"
  >
    {children}
  </Tween>
);
```

Also note the use of the `trigger` prop.
In this case the `<H3>` wouldn't trigger because it's out of the viewport initially: `translate3d(-100vw, 0, 0)`
If no trigger is passed, the first element from any child Tween or Timeline that gets into view is used.

<Playground>
  <Reveal repeat trigger={<div />}>
    <FadeInLeft>
      <h3>This headline is coming from left</h3>
    </FadeInLeft>
  </Reveal>
</Playground>

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| children | React.ReactNode |  |  |
| trigger? | React.ReactElement \| null |  | This element triggers the animation if it gets into view. Needs to be a "refable" element like HTML element or forwardRef component |
| repeat? | boolean | false | Trigger the animation again and again? |
| root? | Element \| null | null |  |
| rootMargin? | string | 0px |  |
| threshold? | number | 0.66 | As opposed to the threshold value from IntersectionObserver options this is just a single number |
